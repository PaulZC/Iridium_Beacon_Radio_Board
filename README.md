A radio board for the [Iridium 9603N Beacon](https://github.com/PaulZC/Iridium_9603_Beacon). Equipped with an
[LPRS eRIC4 or eRIC9 integrated radio module](http://www.lprs.co.uk/products/easyradio-ism-modules/eric-soc-rf-modules.html),
this board allows remote control of radio-enabled devices near the Iridium Beacon. E.g. a
[radio-enabled cut-down device](https://github.com/PaulZC/Pyrotechnic_Balloon_Cut-Down).
